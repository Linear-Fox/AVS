## Introduction
Audio-visual synthesis refers to the process of generating audio from a given video or generating video from a given audio. This project demonstrates how to perform audio-visual synthesis using pre-trained TensorFlow models in C++.

## Getting Started
To use this code, you'll need to have the TensorFlow C++ library installed. You can download it from the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/install/lang_c">official TensorFlow website</a>.
